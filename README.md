# tinder-unmatch

This is a pretty simple script to remove any matches from tinder without messages or who haven't logged on in 2017.

## Examples

`git clone` the repo

Step 1: Get your fb token:
run
`python tinder.py`
(you may need to `pip install` some missing packages);

Step 2: Get your fb id from here: http://findmyfbid.com/

Copy+paste these values in `tinder.js` for `FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `FACEBOOK_ID`

Step 3: run `node index.js`

## Enjoy your more efficient tinder experience
